# Go Programming Language Tutorial

This repository contains a step-by-step tutorial to help you get started with Go programming language. The tutorial covers everything from installation to writing basic programs, data types, control structures, functions, and much more.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you'll need the following:

- **Windows 11** (but should work on other operating systems too)
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** installed
- **Go Programming Language** installed on your machine

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install Go

1. Go to the official [Go download page](https://go.dev/dl/).
2. Download the Go installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Go.

#### 2. Verify Go Installation

After installation, open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, and check the Go version to verify that the installation was successful.

```bash
go version
```
```

This should display the installed version of Go, like so:
```
go version go1.19.5 windows/amd64
```

#### 3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. Go to the official [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download and install the Windows version of VS Code.
3. Once installed, open VS Code.

#### 4. Install Go Extension for VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking on the Extensions icon on the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for **Go** and install the official Go extension by **Go Team at Google**.

## Setting Up Your Go Workspace

1. **Set the Go Path**  
   Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, and set the `GOPATH` environment variable:

   ```bash
   setx GOPATH "%USERPROFILE%\go"
   setx PATH "%PATH%;%GOPATH%\bin"
   ```

2. **Create a Project Folder**  
   Navigate to your workspace directory (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\go\src`), and create a new folder for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir %USERPROFILE%\go\src\hello
   cd %USERPROFILE%\go\src\hello
   ```

3. **Create Your First Go File**  
   Inside your project folder (`hello`), create a file named `main.go`. You can do this from within VS Code or using the command line.

---

## Writing Your First Go Program

1. Open `main.go` in VS Code, and add the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

2. **Run the Program**

In your **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, navigate to the project folder (`hello`) and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Tutorial Overview

### 1. **Variables and Constants**

In Go, variables can be declared using `var` or shorthand `:=`. Constants are declared using the `const` keyword.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x int = 10
    y := 20
    const z = 30

    fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

### 2. **Control Structures**

Go supports standard control structures like `if`, `for`, and `switch`.

```go
// if-else
if x > 10 {
    fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")
} else {
    fmt.Println("x is 10 or less")
}

// for loop
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

### 3. **Functions**

Functions in Go are defined using the `func` keyword. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    result := add(5, 3)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

### 4. **Structs and Interfaces**

Go supports struct-based object-oriented programming. Here's an example of a struct and an interface:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}

type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return 3.14 * c.Radius * c.Radius
}

func main() {
    p := Person{Name: "John", Age: 30}
    fmt.Println(p)

    var s Shape = Circle{Radius: 5}
    fmt.Println("Area:", s.Area())
}
```

## Build and Install Your Program

To build your Go program into an executable file:

1. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
go build
```

This will generate an executable file in your project directory (e.g., `hello.exe` on Windows).

2. To run the built executable:

```bash
./hello
```
